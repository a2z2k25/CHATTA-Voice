## 🟡 Community Help Needed

> **Note**: These integration guides were created based on documentation and API specifications. We haven't yet tested installing and configuring each desktop application firsthand. If you're familiar with any of these tools, we'd greatly appreciate your review and feedback!
> 
> **How you can help:**
> - Test the integration steps with your tool
> - Submit issues for any inaccuracies or missing steps
> - Open PRs with improvements or corrections
> - Share tips that would help newcomers
>
> These guides are written for complete beginners - someone who has never used the tool before. Each guide should walk through everything from installation to first voice conversation.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose your tool** from the list above
2. **Follow the integration guide** specific to your tool

4. Fill in all the placeholders with tool-specific information
5. Add screenshots or example configs if helpful
6. Update this README.md to include the new integration
